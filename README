                               GENERAL
==============================================================================
Cloonix is an AGPLv3 software that constitutes a tool to create networks of
kvm virtual machines or crun containers. It provides a graphical interactive
canvas showing the topology for your network, cloonix is a kind of
virtualisation hypervisor.

The network connecting the virtual machines and containers is created through
the use of the openvswitch (ovs) software running inside a linux net namespace
so that your host is isolated from cloonix network configuration.
That way, "ip link" on your host is not messed up with openvswitch bridges
and ports.

2 supports are provided for installation: BUNDLE or EXTRACTOR
Building of the binaries is done in a virtual debian trixie, all the necessary
files and libraries are collected and put either into a bundle or in a
self-extracting script file.
To install the bundle, you must have the root privileges but to install with
the extractor, you only need a user on a linux machine, it is self-extracting.

3 brandtypes of virtualizations run in cloonix: KVM, ZIP or CVM
For language simplification, "virtualisation" is used both for the emulation
of a complete guest machine, kernel and root file-system (KVM qemu using qcow2)
and the containerisation using the host's kernel to run the root file-system.
ZIP and CVM are run with crun, a C implementation of the Open Container Initiative.
ZIP root fs is a zip file and CVM root fs is a directory, it becomes / in the
container.

                          BUNDLE INSTALLATION
==============================================================================
The bundle way for installation is based on cloonix-bundle-49-00.tar.gz,
it copies binary files to /usr/libexec/cloonix/cloonfs directory of your host,
puts bash scripts in /usr/bin/cloonix_xxx and uses /var/lib/cloonix as work zone.
With this choice, root privileges are necessary for installation and
as there are cloonix actions that are related to namespaces or networks,
some binaries have the suid root permissions to run with higher privileges.

1) Download software and installation:
--------------------------------------

wget http://clownix.net/downloads/cloonix-49/cloonix-bundle-49-00.tar.gz
tar xvf cloonix-bundle-49-00.tar.gz
cd cloonix-bundle-49-00
sudo ./install_cloonfs

(To uninstall:   sudo rm -f /usr/bin/cloonix_*
                 sudo rm -rf /usr/libexec/cloonix
                 sudo rm -rf /var/lib/cloonix)


2) Download virtual machines and containers:
------------------------------------------

mkdir -p /var/lib/cloonix/bulk
cd /var/lib/cloonix/bulk

qcow2 (virtual machine for qemu-kvm):
wget http://clownix.net/downloads/cloonix-49/bulk/bookworm.qcow2.gz
gunzip bookworm.qcow2.gz

zip (container for crun):
wget http://clownix.net/downloads/cloonix-49/bulk/zipfrr.zip

cvm (container for crun):
wget http://clownix.net/downloads/cloonix-49/bulk/bookworm0.tar.gz
tar xvf bookworm0.tar.gz


3) Download demo script file:
-----------------------------

cd ${HOME}
wget http://clownix.net/downloads/cloonix-49/demos/ping_demo.sh

==============================================================================

==============================================================================
                          EXTRACTOR INSTALLATION
==============================================================================
The extractor way based on cloonix-extractor-49-00.sh enters a user namespace
with the help of the crun open source.
It is a self-extracting shell script that never needs any privileges either
at install or at run.
This is a user land application, very usefull if you are an unprivilege user
on a linux machine.
This script is based on makeself.sh open source, it creates a directory
called dir_self_extracted associated to a handle executable script file
called nemocmd by default.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Download:
------------
wget http://clownix.net/downloads/cloonix-49/cloonix-extractor-49-00.sh

2) Extract the bundle:
----------------------
./cloonix-extractor-49-00.sh

3) The nemocmd script is now present, first start it:
-----------------------------------------------------
./nemocmd start

4) Call the gui to see the demo canvas, a X11 display:
------------------------------------------------------
./nemocmd canvas

5) Call the frr demo with more than 50 crun containers:
-------------------------------------------------------
./nemocmd demo_frr

6) Kill all:
------------
./nemocmd stop 


NOTE FOR KVM USE AS A SIMPLE USER
=================================
For the cloonix to be able to use the qcow2 files, devices /dev/kvm,
/dev/vhost-net and /dev/net/tun, must have read/write access by the user
launching the demonstration.

                         NOTES FOR THE CANVAS GUI
==============================================================================

cloonix_gui nemo gives the canvas gui, on this canvas a double-click or a right
click when above no object gives the canvas menu.

A double-click on a blue machine gives a shell, a double-click on the green
interface (small peripheral circle) gives a wireshark spy, a right-click on
the blue machine gives a menu from which you can choose a spice desktop (only
for kvm based virtuals).

The crun containers zip or cvm are smaller, a double-click in the blue zone
gives a shell, right-click on the container gives a menu from which you can
pick a remote console.

==============================================================================

==============================================================================
                            DISTANT WEB GUI:
==============================================================================
Default value for the web gui is off, to set it on:

In the bundled install:
cloonix_cli nemo cnf web on

In the extractor install:
./nemocmd web_on

Xvfb creates a virtual framebuffer on a defined DISPLAY,
this display can be seen through its X11 socket at /tmp/.X11-unix/.
Then on this display, wm2 is launched, it is a very small windows manager.
When the wm2 representation gets to be visible in your browser,
click on the main mouse button, and choose the only choice which is "cloonix".
x11vnx carries the equivalent of a desktop to the vnc server and
finaly websockify puts this desktop inside a web browser.

For nemo the http link for the browser is:

   http://<ip_of_server>:54521

Note that the 54521 port can be changed in:

  /usr/libexec/cloonix/common/etc/cloonix.cfg
