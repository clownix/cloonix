==============================================================================
Cloonix is an AGPLv3 software that constitute a tool to create networks of
kvm virtual machines or crun containers. It provides a graphical interactive
canvas showing the topology for your network, cloonix is a virtualisation
hypervisor.

The network connecting the virtual machines and containers is created through
the use of the openvswitch software running inside a net namespace so that
your host is isolated from cloonix. That way, "ip link" on your host
shows clean results. Type "ip netns" to see cloonix namespaces.

Building of the binaries is done on a debian trixie, all the necessary files
and libraries are collected and put into an autonomous bundle, this makes
the bundle self-contained. No added files or packages are necessary.

See clownix.net for a documentation.
http://clownix.net/doc_stored/build-45-00/html/index.html doc.

NOTE: qemu-guest-agent also called qemu-ga has to be installed inside the kvm
      guests virtual machines to have the pseudo-ssh and pseudo-scp cloonix api.
      For Fedora, in /etc/sysconfig/selinux, I set SELINUX=disabled to have
      a qemu-guest-agent that can create and launch a script as root.
      For centos, same for selinux, but also in /etc/sysconfig/qemu-ga, the
      env FILTER_RPC_ARGS must have:"guest-file-open,guest-file-close,
      guest-file-read,guest-file-write,guest-exec-status,guest-exec"
      For ubuntu, "unshare: Operation not permitted" problem,
      echo "kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
      echo "kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
      sysctl -p.
      It is sad that root privilege seems to be necessary in those 2 cases.

There are 2 cloonix products:

The classical way for installation copies binary files to /usr/libexec/cloonix
directory of your host, puts bash scripts user handles in /usr/bin/cloonix_xxx
and uses /var/lib/cloonix as work zone.
With this choice, root privileges are necessary for installation and
as there are cloonix actions that are related to namespaces or networks,
some binaries must have the suid permissions to run with higher privileges.

A more recent and innovative way to use cloonix is based on a crun container.
It is not installed in the usual way, it is a self-extracting shell script,
it never needs any privileges either at install or at run.
This is very secure way to test cloonix as a normal user.

              HOST CLASSICAL INSTALLATION (NEEDS ADMIN PERMISSIONS) 
==============================================================================

1) Download software and installation:
--------------------------------------

wget http://clownix.net/downloads/cloonix-45/cloonix-bundle-45-01-amd64.tar.gz
tar xvf cloonix-bundle-45-01-amd64.tar.gz
cd cloonix-bundle-45-01-amd64
sudo ./install_cloonix

(To uninstall:   sudo rm -f /usr/bin/cloonix_*
                 sudo rm -rf /usr/libexec/cloonix
                 sudo rm -rf /var/lib/cloonix)


2) Download virtual machine and container:
------------------------------------------

mkdir -p /var/lib/cloonix/bulk
cd /var/lib/cloonix/bulk

wget http://clownix.net/downloads/cloonix-45/bulk/bookworm.qcow2.gz
gunzip bookworm.qcow2.gz

wget http://clownix.net/downloads/cloonix-45/bulk/zipfrr.zip


3) Download demo script file:
-----------------------------

cd ${HOME}
wget http://clownix.net/downloads/cloonix-45/demos/ping_demo.sh


4) Use cloonix:
---------------

On the canvas gui, a double-click on a blue machine gives a shell,
a double-click on the green interface (small peripheral circle) gives a wireshark spy,
a right-click on the blue machine can give a spice desktop for a kvm based on qemu.

The crun container are smaller, based on a zip root file-system, the same action
to get a shell: a double-click in the blue zone gives a shell,
a right-click on the container can give a remote console.

==============================================================================
                ROOTLESS SELF EXTRACTING CLOONIX
==============================================================================
To test cloonix without ever having the root password for your host machine,
you have to use the cloonix_extractor.sh script.

This script is based on makeself.sh open source, it creates a directory
called dir_self_extracted associated to a handle executable script file
called nemocmd by default.

1) Download:
------------
wget http://clownix.net/downloads/cloonix-45/cloonix_extractor.sh

2) Extract the bundle:
----------------------
./cloonix_extractor.sh

3) The nemocmd script is now present, first start it:
-----------------------------------------------------
./nemocmd start

4) Call the gui to see the demo canvas, a X11 display:
------------------------------------------------------
./nemocmd canvas

5) Call the frr demo with more than 50 crun containers:
-------------------------------------------------------
./nemocmd demo_frr

6) Kill all:
------------
./nemo_cmd stop 


NOTE FOR KVM USE AS A SIMPLE USER
=================================
For the cloonix to be able to use the qcow2 files, devices /dev/kvm,
/dev/vhost-net and /dev/net/tun, must have read/write access. For this
some commands must be done as root to provide read/write access that
are privileges:

             sudo setfacl -m u:${USER}:rw /dev/kvm
             sudo setfacl -m u:${USER}:rw /dev/vhost-net
             sudo setfacl -m u:${USER}:rw /dev/net/tun
     or:
             sudo chmod 666 /dev/kvm
             sudo chmod 666 /dev/vhost-net
             sudo chmod 666 /dev/net/tun

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

==============================================================================
                            DISTANT WEB GUI:
==============================================================================
Default value for the web gui is off, to set it on:

In classical:
cloonix_cli nemo cnf web on

In extractor:
./nemocmd web_on

Xvfb creates a virtual framebuffer on a defined DISPLAY,
this display can be seen through its X11 socket at /tmp/.X11-unix/.
Then on this display, wm2 is launched, it is a very small windows manager.
When the wm2 representation gets to be visible in your browser,
click on the main mouse button, and choose the only choice which is "cloonix".
x11vnx carries the equivalent of a desktop to the vnc server and
finaly websockify puts this desktop inside a web browser.

For nemo the http link for the browser is::

   http://<ip_of_server>:54521

Note that the 54521 port can be changed in::

  /usr/libexec/cloonix/common/etc/cloonix.cfg
