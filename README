Cloonix is an AGPLv3 software that constitute a tool to create networks of
kvm virtual machines or crun, docker and podman containers.

The network connecting the virtual machines and containers is created through
the use of the openvswitch software running inside a net namespace so that
your host is not polluted with bridges and "ip addr" on your host shows clean
results.

The openvswitch commands are simplified by cloonix which provides a very
simple user interface to connect virtual machines and containers through
virtual lans.

Cloonix provides root access pseudo-ssh and pseudo-scp (ssh and scp equivalent)
for every virtual machines or containers without use of any ip interface
inside the virtual machines or container.

Cloonix provides a graphical interactive canvas showing the topology for
your network.

Building of the binaries is done on a debian bookworm and all the necessary
files and libraries are collected and put into an autonomous bundle, this
makes the bundle self-contained. No added files or packages are necessary.

See clownix.net for a documentation (which is usually not up to date).
http://clownix.net/doc_stored/build-30-01/html/index.html doc.

NOTE: qemu-guest-agent sometimes called qemu-ga has to be installed
      inside the kvm guests virtual machines to have the pseudo-ssh and
      pseudo-scp.

NOTE: It is now strongly advised to install with the bundle of binaries,
      libraries and config files, much simpler method than by compiling.

NOTE: If you have an old version of cloonix, you must erase it first,
      the way to erase the old version was: "rm -rf /usr/local/bin/cloonix*".
      The new cloonix is not at the same place as before.

tar xvf cloonix-bundle-31-00.tar.gz
cd cloonix-bundle-31-00
sudo ./install_cloonix


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TO UNINSTALL:

rm -f /usr/bin/cloonix_*
rm -rf /usr/libexec/cloonix
rm -rf /var/lib/cloonix

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GET A WORKING QCOW AND PUT IT IN BULK TO TEST KVM:

mkdir -p /var/lib/cloonix/bulk
cd /var/lib/cloonix/bulk
wget http://clownix.net/downloads/cloonix-31/bulk/bookworm.qcow2.gz
gunzip bookworm.qcow2.gz

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GET A WORKING IMG AND PUT IT IN BULK TO TEST CRUN:

mkdir -p /var/lib/cloonix/bulk
cd /var/lib/cloonix/bulk
wget http://clownix.net/downloads/cloonix-31/bulk/bookworm.img.gz
gunzip bookworm.img.gz

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
LAUNCH KVM SCRIPT:

cd cloonix-bundle-31-00
./ping_kvm.sh

On the gui, a double-click on the blue machine gives a shell,
a double-click on the green interface gives a wireshark spy,
a right-click on the blue machine gives a spice desktop.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
LAUNCH CRUN SCRIPT:

cd cloonix-bundle-31-00
./ping_crun.sh

On the gui, a double-click on the blue machine gives a shell,
a double-click on the green interface gives a wireshark spy.
