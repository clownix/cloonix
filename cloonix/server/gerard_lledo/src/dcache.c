/* Locking for the dcache is tricky.  What we try to do is to keep insertions
 * and lookups threadsafe by atomic updates.  That keeps the tree safe, but
 * means that eventually there might be duplicated entries.
 * However, when entry pruning is implemented, there might be a need to take
 * real locks into use.
 *
 * About string handling in this file, it should be said that all strings are
 * provided with a length.  The idea is that usually strings are passed here as
 * they appear on the fuse call (with arbitrary directory depth) but we are
 * just interested on one path token.  Such calculation is done somewhere else,
 * so we just take it from whoever calls us.
 * All this hassle is basically to avoid copying around strings. */
